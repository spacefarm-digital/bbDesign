notes: This instance of the date/time picker is displayed inline for a more convinient browsing experience within the pattern library. Refer to the options in <a href="https://github.com/spacefarm-digital/bbDesign/blob/master/src/assets/toolkit/scripts/dateTimePicker.js" class="underline b">dateTimePicker.js</a> to modify things like allowing manual input, display mode, enabling range selection, etc. The full list of config options can be found in <a class="underline b" href="https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/options/">Flatpickr's docs</a>. The package <a href="https://github.com/spacefarm-digital/bbDesign/blob/master/src/assets/toolkit/scripts/dateTime-bg.js" class="underline b" target="_blank">dateTime-bg.js</a> is used for localization.<br><em>PS Flatpickr doesn't play well with Webpack and UMD systems in general. Refer to <strong>_date-time-picker.scss</strong>, <strong>dateTimePicker.js</strong> and <strong>dateTime-bg.js</strong> for the customized config and styles.</em>
